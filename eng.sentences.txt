This snake up here smelled it.
It enlightens my life.
The dog was really close to dying.
The three live in this village.
This snake's name was Kormsamba.
The sun was very hot on the day (and) so they were thirsty.
So that they remember it.
A voice was heard.
Days, months, and years kept changing one after another.
We left in 1971.
